# Cryptocurrencies

This project outlines the preperation steps on investing into the cryptocurrency market by applying unsupervised machine learning methods. There are 4 parts to this python notebook attached outlining what this project covers:

Preprocessing of a cryptocurrency dataset.
Reducing the dimensions to apply the Principle Componenent Analysis (PCA) algorithm.
Applying the K-means algorithm to create an elbow curve graph and a clustered scatter plot.
Based upon the PCA data of part 2, we'll use the methods in Part 3 to create a new scatter plot and table to view possible tradable cryptocurrencies.
